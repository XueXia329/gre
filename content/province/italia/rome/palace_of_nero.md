### Garden Description

In the Neronian period the architecture and the size of gardens changed substantially, as did the building criteria and the urban organization of the city. With [Nero](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nero-Roman-emperor) the Romans feared for the first time that Rome could become a single, grandiose residence. Suetonius informs that Nero, “having built for himself a house that extended from the Palatine to the Esquiline, first called it '*transitoria*'; then, when it was destroyed by fire, he had it rebuilt and called it '*aurea*' " ([Suet. *Nero*, 31](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:phi,1348,016:31)). Even more than [Augustus' residence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Augustus), the expansive architecture of the Neronian [palace](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300005734) seems to derive from the *basileia* of Egyptian Alexandria, which is known to have occupied vast tracts of that city.

One may suppose that Nero chose the language of refinement and sumptuousness of Hellenistic sovereigns, expressed perfectly by gardens, by combining the splendor and richness of vegetation with the magnificence of architecture, in order to lend a royal component to his imperial power. The Neronian buildings on the Palatine have not been studied in their entirety, but excavations underway are showing ever more precisely their extent.  Physical evidence of these constructions are important because the description of the [*Domus Aurea*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domus_Aurea) and its gardens given by Suetonius ([Suet. *Nero*, 31](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:phi,1348,016:31)) must refer in part to Nero’s buildings and arrangements on the Palatine.

Structures known mistakenly as “Livia’s Baths,” still partially preserved under the [peristyles (Roman courtyards)](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004029) of the [*Domus Flavia*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavian_Palace), are attributed to the [*Domus Transitoria*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domus_Transitoria). They are imposing and luxurious constructions consisting of a [porticoed](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004145) hall with magnificent floors in colored and inlaid [marbles](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300011443), to a large extent belonging to open areas and connected with gardens. Nearby, excavations have discovered waterproofing systems of low [*suspensurae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspensura) that are typical of gardens.

What must originally have been an open area with an elaborate [fountain](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006179) on one side, adorned with [niches](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300002704) imitating the architectural forms of a [theater](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300007117) backdrop ([*scaenae*](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004681)), belongs to Neronian constructions. Opposite the fountain was a [pavilion](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300006819) surrounded by [polychrome]( http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300247962) marble [columns](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300001571) and [pillars](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300264605) and marble [basins](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300045614), perhaps for plantings (Fig. 6). These elements, together with other “stepped” structures for the descent of water, which boldly break up the walls, and [wall paintings](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300177433), which show connections with widespread themes in gardens, have given rise to the hypothesis that this construction could be a [*diaeta*](https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/diaeta-e316370?s.num=11) built in a [terraced](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300004182) open zone. The presence nearby of a large [cistern](http://vocab.getty.edu/page/aat/300052558) of Neronian date confirms the great need for water in this area at that time.
