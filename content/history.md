# History of the Project 

Originally modeled on *Gardens of Pompeii*, with its book of essays and catalogue of archaeological sites, Wilhelmina Jashemski planned *Gardens of the Roman Empire* as a far more ambitious project. It has engaged an interdisciplinary team of nearly 200 scholars, students, volunteers, and specialists to assemble a vast body of data into this digital project, which complements, but is independent of, a print volume of essays published by Cambridge University press. Ultimately, this website is designed to publish the assembled catalogue of material in the format in which Jashemski first envisioned it, while using contemporary digital tools to make the data readily navigable. It takes the project forward into the future with essential search tools, links, and maps. The result is a website that realizes her original vision while transforming the project into a fully independent digital forum for research on Roman gardens and designed landscapes.

## Origins

The seeds of this project were sown in 1955, when Wilhelmina Jashemski set out to record all of the known gardens of the Roman Empire. That year she traveled with husband Stanley Jashemski throughout the Mediterranean and ended with a single day at Pompeii, as she believed the gardens preserved by the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius were already documented and published. It was their first visit overseas and they were not able to find many actual gardens, but Prof. Jashemski built a critical network of scholars. Stanley Jashemski recorded the sites on Kodachrome film, which had recently been marketed for use by educators. This was the beginning of an invaluable record he created of archaeological sites.

During their long trip to Europe in 1959, they spent some weeks in Greece. They saw the gardens excavated by Dorothy Burr Thompson at the Temple of Hephaistos in Athens, but few other ancient garden sites. Rather, this trip allowed Wilhelmina, the daughter of Nebraska farmers, to observe horticultural methods, talk with farmers and gardeners, learn Mediterranean plants and the agricultural calendar, as well as to work with her husband to create a photographic record, later published as *Wildflowers amidst the Ruins* and as the plants catalogue of the *Natural History of Pompeii*.

This trip terminated at Pompeii. The expert on Pompeiian gardens at that time, Tatiana Warscher, convinced the Jashemskis of the need to create a record of Vesuvian gardens. Mme. Warscher passed on her extensive knowledge of the region’s gardens, and they continued to correspond until her death in 1961. The Jashemskis spent the next twenty five years recording and excavating the gardens of Pompeii, Herculaneum, Oplontis and the other villages, villas, and farms of the area, recording 646 gardens and 202 garden paintings for her two volume work, *The Gardens of Pompeii* (1979, 1993). She carried out this work with Stanley Jashemski, who built up his camera equipment, recorded fading wall paintings as well as gardens, drew the plans, and advised on scientific techniques until his death in 1981.

## Collaborative Approach to Gardens of the Roman Empire

In 1979, Wilhelmina Jashemski retired from the University of Maryland. This year was marked by the publication of the Gardens of Pompeii, as well as the spring symposium at Dumbarton Oaks, Ancient Roman Gardens, co-hosted with Landscape Studies Director, Elisabeth Blair MacDougall. The papers included reports by Alarcao on the gardens at Conimbriga, Portugal, by Barry Cunnliffe on Fishbourne Roman Villa, Marcel Le Glay on the gardens of Vienne, and her own work in Campania. This symposium brought together, for the first time, many archaeologists—and students—working on Roman gardens. Jashemski credits the conference with shaping the collaborative format of Gardens of the Roman Empire. A second symposium, Ancient Roman Villa Gardens, added new discoveries from Italy (Eugenia Salza Prina Ricotti and Walter Widrig), the Vesuvian region (Stefano de Caro and Wilhelmina Jashemski), and Montmaurin, Gaul (Jean-Marie Pailler).
During the 1980s, Jashemski sought to advance garden archaeology in Europe through her participation in Dumbarton Oaks events and an extensive program of lectures. Classical archaeologists began to explore areas outside building walls and to share their results with Jashemski. She was in much demand. After work at Pompeii, she undertook excavations at Hadrian’s Villa with Eugenia Salza Prina Ricotti and at Thuburbo Majus with Margaret Alexander. A student of Barry Cunliffe’s, Kathryn Gleason responded to a request from Ehud Netzer to examine the gardens of Herod the Great’s palaces at Judea. She began to develop methods of environmental archaeology to recover evidence of gardens outside the fine preservation conditions of the Vesuvian region.

In 1988, having completed the manuscripts *Gardens of Pompeii* vol. 2, and the *Natural History of Pompeii*, she returned to the idea of *Gardens of the Roman Empire*. She created an international team of archaeologists to serve as area editors of the different provinces of the Empire at its fullest extent under Trajan. They were charged with seeking out and assembling all known Roman gardens into a consistent catalogue style format. This would be paired with a volume of essays, to be published by Cambridge University Press. Some editors wrote up all the entries, while others had garden archaeologists author their own entries. In 1995, Jashemski, together with Kathryn Gleason, area editor for the provinces of the Levant and Asia Minor, hosted a conference at the University of Pennsylvania Museum. The unexpected extent of preserved Roman garden culture astounded everyone and it was clear that much work lay ahead.

By 2005, the compendium of garden sites approached one thousand, including those of the Vesuvian region. The manuscript exceeded the word count allowable for a print volume. Jashemski worked with the area editors to cut their text back to one or two paragraphs. She wrote an abridged version of the Gardens of Pompeii that forms the basis for the entries on this website. Meanwhile, Amina-Aicha Malek, as a fellow at Dumbarton Oaks, assisted Jashemski to contact scholars. New discoveries continued to arrive. Cambridge recommended that the catalogue material be placed in a CD of the catalogue to be inserted in the back of the book to allow full entries with color images. Jashemski was also very pleased that readers would be able to navigate the catalogue on screen while reading the book of essays. Clopper Almon scanned the illustrations and explored alternative formats to expedite the project. Meanwhile, Gleason, Malek and Hartswick focused their attention on assisting Jashemski with the essay volume. This was the state of the project at the time of her death on Dec. 24, 2007. Her executor, Henry Ferry, appointed Kathryn Gleason as executive editor of the project, with Kim Hartswick and Amina-Aicha Malek as co-editors. Michele Palmer took on the role of project manager and Victoria I provided advice on graphic layout. Gleason’s students at Cornell University scanned slides, prepared maps and reconstruction drawings. Working with Beatrice Rehl of Cambridge University Press, the team explored the emerging options for digital publication, as they worked to get the essay volume through press.

By the time the print volume was published, most options for the huge catalogue had proved unworkable due to cost, technical demands, and/or archival stability. Gleason and her students worked with Keith Jenkins of Mann Library at Cornell to create an effective GIS map for navigation, but the text based presentation remained to be designed. Area editor Roger Bagnall proposed having the ISAW digital humanities team create a prototype with blog technology that was inexpensive and archivally stable. Led by Head Librarian David Ratzan and post-doctoral fellow Christian Casey, they designed a prototype that was inexpensive, archivally stable, and relatively simple to build and maintain using readily available blog software. Confined by the COVID pandemic in 2020, ISAW interns, Cornell students, and an international group of volunteers have digitized the manuscript for the *Gardens of the Roman Empire*, bringing it into the future.
